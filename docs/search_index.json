If you are unsure what version you are running click on the Apple icon in the top left of the screen and then About this Mac. Mac hardware must be a 2010 model or newer Docker install steps Go to the dockerhub website. Ensure you meet the criteria for download (it is the same as stated above) and then select Get Stable button. This will then download to your machine but may take some time. Once finished, to access this download go to Finder &gt; Downloads &gt; Docker.dmg and double click. You should then be prompted to drag and drop this application into the applications folder like so: You may get further windows asking for access to the program. To these you can click Open &gt; Ok &gt; enter your account password and click Install helper After you have done this, the whale icon should now show in your taskbar: You have successfully downloaded Docker! Using Docker Now we have Docker installed we can use it to access Python and all the associated packages we need for the practicals Installing the GDS environment Access your terminal: Launchpad &gt; Other &gt; Terminal In a fresh line in the terminal type the following to install the GDS environment container: docker pull darribas/gdsr:1.0alpha This should now prompt a long download process that looks a bit like this: Dont be alarmed if it seems to take a very long time. IMPORTANT: Make sure you are connected to the internet and it is a stable connection. This step involves the download of large amounts of data (ca. 10GB) so it might take a while. However, it only needs to be run once. Check success You will know the process has completed successfully when each line says Pull complete and the new line shows your machine name. If everything has gone according to plan, you should see darribas/gds:5.0 show up on your terminal when you type docker image ls (note in the image below there are other containers that are not required, do not worry if you dont have those or slightly different values on the ID and the CREATED columns, the important bit is having darribas/gds:5.0 listed): Running Python The following sections cover how to spin up a session you have just installed, use it, and shut it down when you are done. Running the container In the new terminal line type the following command to run the container: docker run --rm -ti -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work darribas/gds:5.0 You have now started a Python session. IMPORTANT: Please do NOT close the terminal window until you are finished in this Python session To access this session go to your chosen web browser (e.g. Safari/Chrome) and type: localhost:8888 into the search bar The page that loads will prompt you for a password or a token. This can be found in the text in the terminal following the last command you ran (step 9). A long series of numbers and letters will be preceded by ?token=. Copy this long series of characters and paste into the password box in your browser. Now you are in Jupyter Lab you can open up a Python 3 notebook Using Jupyter Notebook This notebook is where you will run your code. Each shaded box is called a kernel. To test this out you can type print('test') into one of these kernels. To run the code use the shortcut Ctrl + Enter. IMPORTANT: Make sure you save files you want to keep ONLY within the work folder, as this will ensure they are saved on your machine. Everything saved outside the work folder will be destroyed as soon as you shut down the session. You can access other files on your machine through the work folder in the File Browser. From here you can navigate to your Documents and designated folder for this module. Here I am navigating to the GDS folder that I have created for this module in my Documents. You can replace this with the pathway to the folder you create for this module. You can save your notebook here using File &gt; Save notebook as And you can create new folders to organise your work Ending your session Once you have finished in your Jupyter session and have saved all your work, you can end the session from the terminal. Using Ctrl + C will prompt a y/n option. Either type y or Ctrl + C again to end the session. You can now safely shut the terminal window. Next time you go to run a Jupyter Notebook you will not need to repeat the whole process as you have already installed Docker and the GDS environment. Instead you can start from Running the container and carry on from there.

You can check available distributions for ready installation on this page. NOTE If you are running a different distribution (e.g. Arch Linux), there is a good chance Docker will work, but you will have to source your own instructions for installation. Once you have Docker up and running on your machine, you can move to Installing the GDS container. Docker install steps Select the page for your distribution from the Docker Hub list of supported distributions For this example, we will use Ubuntu. Make sure that you meet the requirements to install Docker: Follow the steps specified on the official install guide: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ Once you complete these steps successfully, you will have Docker ready to go on your computer, congratulations! Installing the GDS container Once you have Docker installed and running on your machine, installing everything you need to run Python and associated libraries boils down to the following two steps: Open your terminal app of choice (for example, Gnome Terminal) Run the following command: docker pull darribas/gds:5.0 You will know this has completed when each line says Pull complete.

"],["win10pro.html", "Windows 10 Pro/Education Installing Docker Running RStudio Server", " Windows 10 Pro/Education This guide shows you how to install Docker and run R/RStudio virtually using an environment we have created called darribas/gdsr:1.0alpha (Arribas-Bel 2019). This approach is preferred for anyone using Windows 10 Pro/Education because it avoids potential compatibility issues between the latest versions of R/RStudio and other software on your computer. Please therefore follow these steps even if R/RStudio is already installed on your computer. Installing Docker Requirements To be able to complete this guide, your machine will need to meet the following requirements: A stable internet connection ~10GB of space on your hard drive Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 16299 or later). You can see the full requirements on the official Docker for Windows page. IMPORTANT: If you are not sure what version of Windows you are running, check out this guide. If you know you dont have Windows 10 Pro, for example you are running Windows 10 Home, please use this install/run guide. Docker install steps Once you have everything required ready to go, the first step is to install the Docker Desktop App for Windows. Here are the steps you can follow: Head over to Docker Hub to download a copy of Docker for Windows: https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/ Download a copy of the Docker Desktop (highlighted in red on the image above). Click Save File. Note the file is approximately 490Mb so, depending on your internet connection, it might take a while to download. Double click on the file you downloaded (a cute white whale on a blue background) and the installation wizard will appear. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the install. You can check the process has completed successfully by following these steps: Open PowerShell from the Start Menu Check Docker is available by printing out the version you have installed: docker --version Note: Dont worry if you have you installed a slightly different version of Docker - thats OK. What you want to make sure is that it successfully prints out a version instead of a warning/error message (usually in red). Installing the container Once you have Docker installed and running on your machine, installing everything you need to run Python and associated libraries boils down to the following two steps: Open PowerShell following the same steps as above (you can use the same window as before or a fresh new one). Run (type and hit Enter) the following command: docker pull darribas/gdsr:1.0alpha You will know this has completed when each line says Pull complete. IMPORTANT: Make sure you are connected to the internet and it is a stable connection. This step involves the download of large amounts of data (ca. 10GB) so it might take a while. However, it only needs to be run once. Check success If everything has gone according to plan, you should see darribas/gds:5.0 show up on your terminal when you type docker image ls: Running RStudio Server The following sections cover how to start up the software you have just installed, use it, and shut it down when you are done.
