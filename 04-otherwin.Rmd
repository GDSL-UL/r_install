# Windows 10 Home/pre-10 {#otherWin .unnumbered}

This guide covers the installation of R and RStudio on machines running Windows 10 Home Edition or versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 (e.g. Windows 7). With this approach, you will install R and RStudio "natively", that is running directly on your operating system. If you are not sure what version of Windows you are running, check out this [guide](#windows-version).

<div class="alert alert-danger" style="font-size:120%">
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: <br>
    
This module has been written using the most up-to-date versions of R, RStudio and relevant packages. To avoid software compatibility issues it is important you have these same versions installed on your home computer.

**Therefore, if you have R or RStudio already installed on your computer, please first uninstall them unsing the instructions [here](#uninstall_otherwin).**
